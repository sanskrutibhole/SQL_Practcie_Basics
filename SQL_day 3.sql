-- GROUP BY
-- The GROUP BY clause in SQL is used to group rows that have the same values into summary rows.
-- It is often used in conjunction with aggregate functions (like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), etc.) 
-- to perform calculations on each group separately.
-- COUNT(*) is generally faster than COUNT (column_name) because it doesn't need to check for NULL 
-- orderby can be done by column index (not suggested)

-- where used to filter records from the table based on condition 
-- having: filter records from the groups
-- where: row wise implemenatation but having does columnwise opeartions
